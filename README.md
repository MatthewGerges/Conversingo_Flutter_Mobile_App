- Conversingo is a mobile application I developed on Flutter that acts as a conversation starter app and includes more than 1000 questions that are sorted by collections on Google's Cloud Firestore

- It also features a submit question page wherein a user can submit their custom questions to be visible in the app under the collection of their choice (if they have access to a password I created)

- Conversingo is now live as a web application (hosted through Firebase) and can be visited at: https://conversingoweb.web.app/

- Note: The application's code is contained within the lib folder of this project
